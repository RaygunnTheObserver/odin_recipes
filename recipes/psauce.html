        <h4>Hearty Tomato Vegetable Pasta Sauce</h4>
        <p>This is a recipe I've just kind of intuitively improvised over time
            and without reference to anything.</p>
        <p>It's a great dish for meal prep, since it's generally only half the
            work to make a double batch that lasts in the fridge all week. I
            basically size the ingredients list proportionally to the size of the
            largest pot at my disposal</p>
