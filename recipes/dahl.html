        <h3>Quick & Easy Red Lentil Dahl</h3>
        <p> I found this recipe online because I was looking for a quick and
            easy Indian dish to make that was also high in protein. Originally
            from <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/red-lentil-dahl/">noracooks.com</a>,
            I have made a few small adjustments to suit the household's tastes.</p>
        <p> This recipe has been in my family for literally 3 millenia. In fact,
            part of its ingredients list is visible on the famous Rosetta Stone,
            used to decode the languages of ancient civilizations. Trust me, I have
            a degree in archaeology.</p>
